# Lambda-Fellows

This website is dedicated to companies who take part in the [Lambda Fellows](https://lambdaschool.com/lambda-fellows) program from Lambda School.

It's hosted at https://lambdafellows.dev

# Developing

Currently, the site is a single HTML file, index.html, that you can open locally in your web browser while developing.

PRs are welcome! I will be building out more infrastructure around this soon (License, code of conduct, CSS, etc.)
